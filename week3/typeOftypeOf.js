//#17: What does the following code return? (And why?)

//let bar = 42;
//typeof typeof bar;
////â€˜Coerce' means to try to change - so coercing var x = '6' to number means trying to change the type to number temporarily.

let bar = 42;
typeof typeof bar;

console.log(typeof typeof bar);
//bar is of type Number and by typing typeof number, the result becomes a string
